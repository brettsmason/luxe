// Settings.
//
// Settings are handled in the tailwind.config.js file.


// Base.
//
// This is the first point that real CSS is output. Resets, normalization,
// fonts, etc. are best handled here. These are the base styles that other
// styles will build upon.

@import "base/tailwind";


// Components.
//
// Components make up the bulk of the actual theme design.  Nearly
// every piece of the design is some type of component, whether it"s
// a one-off or reusable block of code.

@import "components/tailwind";


// Utilities.
//
// Utilities are helper classes and overrides.  This gets loaded last.
// If necessary, this is the only place where `!important` rules should
// go, but only if necessary.

@import "utilities/tailwind";
