/**
 * This is the primary stylesheet. We don't actually write any styles here.
 * Instead, we import all of our styles from partials within the sub-folders.
 * This file is set up based on the Inverted Triangle CSS (ITCSS) system,
 * which gets more specific as we drill down each layer.  This keeps your
 * style code lean and organized.
 *
 * The bulk of your code should be within the `/components` folder.  By
 * default, we follow the Block-Element-Modifier (BEM) system in our HTML.
 * Each "block" is a "component" in our CSS.

// SETTINGS
//
// Settings handle the configuration and don't output CSS. This is a good
// place to define things like variables.

@import "settings/colors";
@import "settings/global";
@import "settings/typography";


// TOOLS
//
// These are used throughout the code but don't output CSS on their own.
// Things like mixins and extensions go here.

// GENERIC
//
// This is the first point that real CSS is output. Resets, normalization,
// fonts, etc. are best handled here. These are the base styles that other
// styles will build upon.

// ElEMENTS
//
// Elements are (or should be) class-less designs for the base

// a one-off or reusable block of code.

//
// Vendor files handle code for specific plugins and third-party
// scripts that would overwrite earlier styles.

//
// Utilities are helper classes and overrides.  This gets loaded last.
// If necessary, this is the only place where `!important` rules should
// go, but only if necessary.
